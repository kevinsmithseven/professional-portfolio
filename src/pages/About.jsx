            Greetings!<br>
            </br><br></br>
            Welcome to my portfolio. I am a former US Army Officer and career defense professional who is trying to make a career change into Software Development. I am currently completing a three month Full Stack Software Development boot camp through SMU in Dallas, TX where I am gaining experience in many Full Stack technologies.<br></br><br></br>

            Most of my experience in the defense industry has been in finance, manufacturing, and operations management. I have experience in both leading teams and managing complex programs. I am hoping that leveraging my new skills, I can reenter the defense world as a Software Engineer.<br></br><br></br>

            This career change is both exciting, and terrifying. However, through completing this course, I believe I have a solid foundation from which to build a new career from. Please feel free to click on the portfolio page at the link above to see some of the cool projects I have created as part of this program, and stay tuned for upcoming additions as I continue to learn and add to my portfolio.
